> 🚨 **Educational Proof of Concept – Use Responsibly**

**react2shellpoc** is a sleek and minimal **proof-of-concept** project that demonstrates how a **React-based frontend** can interact with **system-level shell commands**.

The goal of this project is to explore:
- 🔗 UI → OS communication flows  
- 🧱 Execution boundaries & isolation layers  
- ⚠️ Security risks caused by misconfiguration or poor sandboxing  

This repository is designed **strictly for educational, research, and security testing purposes**.  
It highlights how modern web interfaces can become dangerous when backend execution is improperly controlled.
